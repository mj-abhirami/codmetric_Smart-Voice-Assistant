# codmetric_Smart-Voice-Assistant 

Developed as part of my internship at **Codmetric (May–June 2025)**, this is a smart voice assistant built using Python and Tkinter. It continuously listens for commands, responds through speech, and performs tasks like telling the time, weather, jokes, and opening apps – all through a user-friendly GUI.
